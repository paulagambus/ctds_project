# Project Title
Computational Tools for Data Science: Movie Recommendation System

# Overview
This project develops a personalized movie recommendation system. It leverages sentiment analysis, clustering, and similarity detection techniques to suggest movies that align with user preferences, while also identifying which streaming platforms they are available on.

# Usage
The notebook ctds_g6_project.ipynb contains all the code used to build the recommendation system and specifically it comprises:

- retriving data
- data processing
- methodologies which comprends the implementation of clustering, similar items minhashing and sentiment

**Note** that to run <font color="black"> *ctds_g6_project.ipynb* </font> the *TMDB_all_movies.csv* dataset is required which, due to it's capacity, can't be uploaded to the repository and has to be installed locally from this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tgYgMvRtfBQpeuRIT9RyTGuw1mtx_cYB/view?usp=drive_link 

Once <font color="black"> *ctds_g6_project.ipynb* </font> is run, input a reference movie title to receive 10 similar movie suggestions, categorized by clusters, with streaming platform availability.
